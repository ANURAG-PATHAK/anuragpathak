# Welcome to My Portfolio Website! 🚀

Hello there! 👋 Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio website. It's built with some of the coolest technologies out there: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). I'm excited to share it with you!

## About the Project 🌐

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey in the world of software development so far. It showcases my projects, skills, and all the fun I've had coding. I've built it to be fast, responsive, and user-friendly.

## Built With 🛠️

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **[GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)**: Professional-grade JavaScript animation for the modern web. GSAP is robust, compatible, flexible, and extensible.
